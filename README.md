# CrowdFace

Neural-Adaptive Crowd Segmentation with Contextual Pixel-Space Advertisement Integration

## Overview

CrowdFace is an advanced computer vision system that combines state-of-the-art segmentation models with contextual advertisement placement. The system is designed to identify and analyze crowd scenes, segment individuals, and intelligently place advertisements in appropriate spaces within the video frame.

## Features

- **Advanced Crowd Segmentation**: Uses SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) for precise crowd detection and segmentation
- **Robust Video Matting**: Implements RVM (Robust Video Matting) for high-quality alpha matte generation
- **Contextual Ad Placement**: BAGEL (ByteDance Ad Generation and Embedding Library) for intelligent ad placement
- **Multi-platform Support**: Works on various operating systems with GPU acceleration
- **AWS Integration**: Seamless deployment and scaling on AWS infrastructure

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Identifies and segments people in crowd scenes
2. **Matting Module**: Creates precise alpha mattes for seamless integration
3. **Injection Module**: Places advertisements contextually within the scene
